# GitHub Copilot Instructions

- Always include pt-BR translations for any new text added to the project.
- fazer.ai is always styled as-is, with a dot and lowercase letters. Never use Fazer.ai
- Always check if adding specs is necessary when modifying code.
- Evaluate if specs added are actually needed and not redundant. Specs should not be for documentation purposes only, they should cover expected behavior.
- Always evaluate if frontend changes are needed when modifying backend code, and vice versa.
- NEVER use `--` in `pnpm test -- <file>`. Just do `pnpm test <file>` directly
